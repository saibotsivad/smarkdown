title: How to Use
date: 2013-12-13 01:17

1) Go to your server, then type in `git clone https://github.com/saibotsivad/smartstrap.git`
2) Point Apache for your domain to the `smartstrap` folder, or rename it
3) ...
4) Profit?

Customize
---------

* Change the `$info` variable inside `./index.php` to whatever you want.

These variables are only used in the template, so you really can put anything in there you want.

* Put your own content in the `./content` folder.

Any file with the `.md` extension is [markdown][Markdown]. The extra bits at the top are available
inside the template, so `title: How to Use` is in the template as `{$title}` and shows as `How to Use`.

* Templating uses [smarty][Smarty], and the template files are in `./template`


Be More Awesome
---------------

Host your blog on github, then clone it as the content folder. May have to symlink it, if your
naming is different.


Magic
-----

There's some magic going on to give you a *posts vs pages* idea. You don't have to play along, but
here's how it works:

Links like `site.com/bydate/2013/12/24/christmas-time` will map to `./content/bydate/2013-12-24_christmas-time.md`

All other links will map like `site.com/any/folder/depth` to `./content/any/folder/depth.md`

Right now the list of posts is generated by putting the tag `archive_list` in the markdown file, with
anything as the value.
