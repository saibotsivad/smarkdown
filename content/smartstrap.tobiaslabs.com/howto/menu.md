excerpt: The skinny on how to make the menu bar work automagically.

---

You'll notice that inside the `smartstrap-configs.php` is a menu array. Change
that, and if you do it right there'll be some automagical stuff happen in the
backend that adds `active` and `odd` or `even` to the class.

Adding children to it will make a dropdown menu!
