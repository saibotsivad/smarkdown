This is an example page. Itâ€™s not a whole lot different from a blog post. It uses MarkDown for
the content, with some extra metadata at the top of the file to describe it better.

You can read the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documentation, it's pretty awesome:

	Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows
	you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then
	convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As a new SmartStrap user, you should go change up these fiiles and write your own content!
