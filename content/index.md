Hey there, thanks for looking at [SmartStrap][smartstrap]!

What it is
----------

The content is written in Markdown, a super simple text with
super simple markup. A lot of cool people like it because it's
easy and enjoyable to write in.

The template used is Smarty, mostly because it's a well written
PHP templating engine with some good basic functionality built in.

The included template is the Twitter Bootstrap, because it's well
written and conforms to specs pretty well.

There's more information available [here](about) on how to use
it, and a [demo][demo] as well.

![That's pretty neat](/content/thatsprettyneat.jpg "How neat is that?")
